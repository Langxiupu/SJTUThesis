abstract = {Summary Dynamic power allocation (DPA) is the key technique to improve the system throughput by matching the offered capacity with that required among distributed beams in multibeam satellite systems. Existing power allocation studies tend to adopt the metaheuristic optimization algorithms such as the genetic algorithm. The achieved DPA cannot adapt to the dynamic environments due to the varying traffic demands and the channel conditions. To solve this problem, an online algorithm named deep reinforcement learning-based dynamic power allocation (DRL-DPA) algorithm is proposed in this paper. The key idea of the proposed DRL-DPA lies in the online power allocation decision making other than the offline way of the traditional metaheuristic methods. Simulation results show that the proposed DRL-DPA algorithm can improve the system performance in terms of system throughput and power consumption in multibeam satellite systems.},

abstract = {Space AI has become increasingly important and sometimes even necessary for government, businesses, and society. An active research topic under this mission is integrating federated learning (FL) with satellite communications (SatCom) so that numerous low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites can collaboratively train a machine learning model. However, the special communication environment of SatCom leads to a very slow FL training process up to days and weeks. This paper proposes NomaFedHAP, a novel FL-SatCom approach tailored to LEO satellites, that (1) utilizes high-altitude platforms (HAPs) as distributed parameter servers (<inline-formula> <tex-math notation="LaTeX">$mathcal {PS}text{s}$ </tex-math></inline-formula>) to enhance satellite visibility, and (2) introduces non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) into LEO to enable fast and bandwidth-efficient model transmissions. In addition, NomaFedHAP includes (3) a new communication topology that exploits HAPs to bridge satellites among different orbits to mitigate the Doppler shift, and (4) a new FL model aggregation scheme that optimally balances models between different orbits and shells. Moreover, we (5) derive a closed-form expression of the outage probability for satellites in near and far shells, as well as for the entire system. Our extensive simulations have validated the mathematical analysis and demonstrated the superior performance of NomaFedHAP in achieving fast and efficient FL model convergence with high accuracy as compared to the state-of-the-art.},
